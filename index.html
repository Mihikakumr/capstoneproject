<p id="paragraph1">It is becoming a trend of wasting food...Farmers try and work <br>their hardest to give us the best meal but we just throw <br>food and waste it! Poor people and beggars do not have money <br>to buy food but we have money and we waste food! It <br> is a sad thing to see food getting wasted. We shall always <br> try our best to save food.</p>
